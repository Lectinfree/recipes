			<h1>The Lectin-Free Diet: Healthy or Not?</h1>
          <div class="col-12 text-center">
            <p>

You may not have heard of the "lectin-free" diet, but you probably know people who avoid eating legumes, whole wheat and nightshades because they're trying to avoid lectins.<br><br>

But what, exactly, are lectins? And should you be following a diet that restricts or eliminates lectins? That depends. Here's a little bit more information to help determine whether or not you need to be paying attention to the lectins in your diet.<br><br>

<h3>What are lectins?</h3>

Lectins are proteins that bind to other carbohydrates. They've been referred to as "anti-nutrients" because they aren't digestible in the human gastrointestinal tract, and could potentially prevent your body from absorbing key minerals like calcium, iron, phosphorus and zinc.<br><br>

Lectins also attach to the cells lining your intestines and can stay there for a fairly long period. Because of this, lectins have the potential to cause an autoimmune response—and this is, in part, what's fueled an anti-lectin movement (for proof, check out the popularity of the paleo diet and the Whole30 diet, both of which eschew many lectin-containing foods).<br><br>

<h3>What is the Lectin-Free Diet?</h3>

The Lectin-Free Diet was developed by Steven Gundry, M.D., a former cardiothoracic surgeon at California's Loma Linda University Medical Center and the founder of the Center for Restorative Medicine in Palm Springs, California. Gundry believes lectins are responsible for numerous physical discomforts, and that they also may cause leaky gut syndrome, where holes develop between the cells lining your GI tract. When the cells lining your intestines are compromised, they can't keep inflammation-triggering toxins and bad bacteria out of your body—nor can they keep good things like nutrients in. There's strong evidence that leaky gut may cause food allergies, inflammatory disease and celiac disease, which are often marked by unpleasant symptoms like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.<br><br>


<h3>So, what foods are high in lectins?</h3>

All plants contain lectins. In nature, lectins serve as a kind of protective measure for plants, as they aren't digestible, and thus should be unappealing to would-be consumers like animals and humans. That strategy hasn't actually worked though, as lectins are still present in about 30% of the food we eat.<br><br>

That said, lectin levels vary. They're highest in raw legumes—such as peas, beans, lentils, soybeans and peanuts—and in whole grains such as wheat, which contains some of the highest lectin levels in the plant world.<br><br>

Nightshade vegetables (eggplant, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes and seed spices), squash and fruit are also higher in lectins, which has led many lectin-free diet promoters to advocate for avoiding these foods.<br><br>

<h3>What foods are low in lectins?</h3>

According to Gundry, these foods are low in lectins and OK to eat on a lectin-free diet.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Avocado</li>
<li>Asparagus</li>
<li>Broccoli, Brussels sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables</li>
<li>Celery</li>
<li>Cooked sweet potatoes</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Leafy green vegetables</li>
<li>Mushrooms</li>
<li>Onion</li>
<li>Pasture-raised meats</li>
</ul>
